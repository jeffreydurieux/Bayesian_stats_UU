  ! Run a bayesian multiple regression: diff = intercept + age * b1 + age^2 * b2
  ! after MODEL: the model is specified.
  ! note: default priors are used
  ! in Mplus the defaults are beta ~ N(0,inf) meaning prior variance of the
  ! entire parameter space
  ! the prior for residual var is inverse gamma (-1, 0)
