!TITLE: Bayesian analysis summary

!VARIABLE: NAMES ARE diff child sex Age Age2;
!USEVARIABLES ARE diff Age Age2;
!OUTPUT: sampstat;


! Run a bayesian multiple regression: diff = intercept + age * b1 + age^2 * b2
! after MODEL: the model is specified. 
! note: default priors are used
! in Mplus the defaults are beta ~ N(0,inf) meaning prior variance of the 
! entire parameter space
! the prior for residual var is inverse gamma (-1, 0)

TITLE: Bayesian analysis with default priors
DATA: FILE IS "\\Client\C$\Users\jeffreydurieux\Documents\phd-delays_nonames.csv";

VARIABLE: NAMES ARE diff child sex Age Age2; ! All the variables in the dataset

USEVARIABLES ARE diff Age Age2; ! The variables we use in this analysis

ANALYSIS:
ESTIMATOR IS bayes; ! Specify that we want to use a Bayesian analysis
Bseed = 23082018; !specify a seed value for reproducing the results
CHAINS = 3; ! set the number of chains we want to use

MODEL: 
[diff] (intercept);       ! specify that we want an intercept
! this model would also work without this line, but this way it is possible to easily set a prior
diff ON Age (Beta_Age);   ! Regression coefficient 1. 
diff ON Age2(Beta_Age2);  ! Regression coefficient 2 
! You need to name these regression coefficients to later set priors
diff (e);                 ! Error variance

! user specified priors
! age ~ N(3, 0.4)
! age^2 N(0,0.1)
MODEL PRIORS:
    Beta_Age ~ N(20, .4);
    Beta_Age2 ~ N(20, .1);

OUTPUT: tech8;
PLOT: type is plot2;
! relative bias: 100% * (model informative prior - model uninformative prior) / model uninformative
